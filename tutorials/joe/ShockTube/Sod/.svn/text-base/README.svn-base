Sod's shock tube problem
************************ 
Three different run types can be performed automatically:

> ./run_single
Run the shock tube problem with Runge-Kutta time integration and the AUSMDV approximate Riemann solver
The solution is compared to the exact solution (corresponding to the currently implemented initial conditions)

> ./run_time_integration
Compare the different time integration schemes (forward Euler, backward Euler, Runge-Kutta, BDF2) with the AUSMDV 
approximate Riemann solver
The solution is compared to the exact solution for each integration scheme, and density is compared among all schemes
The implicit schemes use a larger time step (see input files)

> ./run_space_integration
Compare the different space integration schemes (HLLC, HAENEL, AUSMDV) using the RK time integration scheme
The solution is compared to the exact solution for each integration scheme, and density is compared among all schemes

You can erase all created files to start with a clean sheet with
> ./run_clean

In each case, the gnuplot input file plot the solution on the screen and output eps and tex files for integrating into
documents

Each case also computes the advection of a scalar

The case can easily be modified:
* Different time integration scheme
* Different space integration scheme
* Different initial conditions (the given exact solution corresponds to the implemented initial condition only)
* Without scalar
