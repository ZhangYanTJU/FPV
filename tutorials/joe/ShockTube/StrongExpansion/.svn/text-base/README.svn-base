Strong expansion in shock tube
******************************

The case considers a strong expansion in a 1D shock tube to test the different spatial integration schemes in strong expansions.

To run the case:
> ./run

You can delete all created files and go back to a clean sheet by using:
> ./run_clean

The script runs the code and output the results with gnuplot. Additionally, tex files of the solution are also created for incorporation into a latex document.

The exact solution is given in 
"An accurate and robust flux splitting scheme for shock and contact discontinuities", Wada & Liou, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, vol.18, p.633, 1997.
One can observe that none of the approximate Riemann solvers can correctly capture the temperature profile.
