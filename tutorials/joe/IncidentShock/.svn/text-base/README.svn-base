the case is an impinging shock on a flate plate, the case is reported in Wilcox's book Turbulence Modeling for CFD, 2006
and furthermore given on the enclosed CD. (the inlet profile and the mesh are used from this CD)

un-tar the mesh file: 
$ tar -xvf geom.msh.tar.gz

copy the Makefile int the current directory: 
$ cp $MUM_HOME/makefiles/Makefile .

and compile joe: 
$ make joe

The case has been tested on a 8core work station, 2.3Ghz/core and petsc-3.0 installed. 
Furhtermore only the Wilcox model has been tested for this case (run number = 3). 
The run takes about 30 minutes.

The figure (convergence.reference.png) shows the convergence behavior, which has been created with gnuplot and the gnuplotscript provided here (gp_resid). 

run the case with: 
$ mpirun -np 8 ./joe 3 >log.file & 

you can check the convergence while joe is running:
$ gnuplot < gp_resid
$ firefox convergence.
