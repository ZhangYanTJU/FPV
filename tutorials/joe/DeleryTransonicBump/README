the test case is a transonic flow over a bump, Delery case C in ref:

 	
DELERY, J. M., OFFICE NATIONAL DETUDES ET DE RECHERCHES AEROSPATIALES, CHATILLON, FRANCE
INVESTIGATION OF STRONG SHOCK TURBULENT BOUNDARY LAYER INTERACTION IN 2D TRANSONIC FLOWS WITH EMPHASIS ON TURBULENCE PHENOMENA
AIAA-1981-1245
(American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Fluid and Plasma Dynamics Conference, 14th, Palo Alto, CA, June 23-25, 1981) 

Delery, J.M., 1983. Experimental investigation of turbulence properties
in transonic shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions. AIAA
J. 21, 180.


the case has been tested with Petsc's linear solver, in case you want to use BCGSTAB you will 
have to decrease the cfl number (current cfl number = 50)

takes 1000 iterations on 4 cpus to converge in 5 minutes. 



YOU CAN SIMPLY RUN 
./run
