******************************************************
* STEADY INVISCID FLOW AT MACH M=5 AROUND A CYLINDER *
******************************************************

This tutorial computes the steady inviscid flow around a cylinder. The inflow is at Mach M=5 (M=10 is commented out).
Three different types of runs can be performed:
* constant properties (gamma and R are fixed)
* variable properties analytical (cp and gamma can change with temperature, the analytical function is linear)
* variable properties (cp and gamma are function of the temperature and computed from NASA polynomials)


RUN
***
* Copy first the Makefile from the joe code and compile
	> cp $MUM_HOME/makefiles/Makefile .
	> make joe

* Run the code (constant properties, non-dimensional)
	> mpirun -np 4 ./joe Joe.in 0 

* The other options are
  - constant properties, dimensional:
	> mpirun -np 4 ./joe Joe.in_dimensions 0

  - analyical variable properties (dimensional)
	> mpirun -np 4 ./joe Joe.in_dimensions 1

  - variable properties from tables (always dimensional)
	> mpirun -np 4 ./joe Joe.in_dimensions 2


You can change the type of approximate Riemann solver (SPACE_INTEGRATION), different options are available: HLLC, HAENEL, AUSMDV, ...
