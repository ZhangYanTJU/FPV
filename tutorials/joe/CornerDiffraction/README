SHOCK DIFFRACTION AROUND 90 DEGREES CORNER
******************************************

This tutorial considers the shock diffraction around a sharp corner for an inviscid flow. Two different cases are considered:
* weak shock, where the post-shock conditions are subsonic
* strong shock, where the post-shock conditions are supersonic.
Different meshes with increasing resolution are provided.

To run, the case:
> tar xzvf meshes.tar.gz 
> cp $MUM_HOME/makefiles/Makefile .
> make joe

* edit Joe.in (comment/uncomment the boundary conditions, time step and number of steps depending on the mesh and case)
* run joe
