WELCOME TO TOOLS TUTORIAL

This directory contains 3 examples:
* How to check whether flamelets intersect in the direction of the progress variable (useful before creating table)
* Create chemistry table from flamelet solution files
* Comparison between computed values and exact values from flamelet

All tools require some flamelet solution files which are computed with FlameMaster (H. Pitsch).
The tools TestFlamelet and TestCombustion also requires the thermoproperties input file.
The tool TestCombustion also requires a chemistry table.

* TESTFLAMELET
Just print on screen which flamelet intersects or overlaps with which other one for the chosen 
comparison variable and the location of the last intersection point. It helps make sure that the 
mapping in the progress variable is correct during the creation of the chemistry table.
A typical input file is TestFlamelet.in:
  - VAR_COMPARISON is the variable that should be checked for intersection
  - VAR_PROG is the definition of the progress variable in terms of species
  - WEIGHT_PROG is the definition of the progress variable in terms of weights
  - FLAMELET_LIST_FILENAME is the name of the text file where the flamelet solution files from FlameMaster are listed

* CREATECHEMTABLE
Tool that process flamelet solution files and creates a structured chemistry table. It
can be used for both steady flamelet and FPVA tables. Moreover, it can either create
a structured Cartesian table or a structured "adaptive" table in which the value of the
progress variable from the flamelet solution is used as coordinate, i.e., the coordinate
of the third dimension is a function of the two other dimensions. 2 options are available:
SPECIES or COEFF depending whether the calculation of temperature is done exactly with
NASA polynomials and Newton iterations or using analytical extrapolations.
A typical input file is CreateChemTable.in

* TESTCOMBUSTION
Loads flamelet and uses its Z, H, RHO and CHI/PROGRESS VARIABLE to compute all other thermo properties using
combustion routines. It outputs two files in tecplot format 'TestThermoPropertiesInterpolation.dat' and
'TestThermoProperties.dat'. The first one is the result when the species mass fraction are computed from the
chemistry table through interpolation (based on Z and C/CHI) and the second is when the Yk are directly
taken from the flamelet solution file. I.e., the second one checks only the thermo properties routines while
the first one checks also the interpolation of the chemistry table. The two files can then be used to
compare with the flamelet solution. There should be no visible difference between both.
A typical input file is TestCombustion.in.
