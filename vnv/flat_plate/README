This V&V case: 'flat plate' calculates the skin friction along the plate with ReL=8e5. 

the run script generates a plot with 4 results:
1.) laminar 
2.) turb with the SA model
3.) turb with the SST model (Menter SST k-omega)
4.) turb with the WX model (Wilcox latest k-omega model, see Wilcox Turbulence Modeling for CFD, 2006) 
and compares the results to the analytical Blasius solution (incompressible) and the semi-empirical turbulent solution.
